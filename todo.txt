// Problem 
   in backend/controllers/userController.js  updateUserProfile
      do not have check format for update data (ex: email) 

   in frontend/src/screen/PlaceOrderScreen.js and  frontend/src/reducers/productReducers.js orderCreateReducer
      after first time clicking Place Order button send the data and set orderCreateReducer orderCreate state,
      can't remove it (should be able to Place the new Order,but data/orderCreate still here.)

// Protential problem (i am thinking)

   in frontend/src/actions/userActions.js  logout
      before dispatch don't have [async]

// fixed by myself (not surely)

   in frontend/src/actions/cartActions.js
      actions of removeFromCart add [async] before dispatch, video don't
   
   in frontend/src/screen/CartScreen.js
      given each item a key for their id(item.product) 

// Warning

   !!fixed
   in frontend/src/screen/ProductScreen.js (problem from ./Rating.js)
      value: ProTypes.number.isRequired is undefined, but ProTypes.number work!

// Confusing but no problem

   in frontend/src/reducers/productReducers.js  productDetailsReducer
      if don't return ...state in [case PRODUCT_DETAILS_REQUEST:], will be break(testing by myself)
      actually, I don't fully understand why... 
      and the next two unneeded( [case PRODUCT_DETAILS_SUCCESS:] and [case PRODUCT_DETAILS_FAIL:] )
      , that confusing me.

      (1) it's because Continuity?? [PRODUCT_DETAILS_REQUEST] action dispatch before the next two action
         (changing sequence, the problem still exists)

      (2) or just all of the reducers should at least return something (state is default content)

      option (2) I think is the answer.

// learing JS method

   in frontend/src/screen/CartScreen.js 
       [...Array(item.countInStock).keys()]     [ [...Array( ).keys()] ] to get key of array 
      cartItems.reduce( (acc,curItem) => acc + curItem.qty, 0 )   [ reduce(acc,cur)=>   ] function to accumulator total of qty
      toFixed(2)     to two decimal(小數)
